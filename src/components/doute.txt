    line->24
    {/* {  `user name : ${user} and age : ${age} `} */}

------------------------------

2)
when we use the predefined components like
    <div age="10">ali</div>
it means
    React.createElement("div", {
    age: "10"
    }, "ali");

but when we make the custom components like
    <ALI age= "10"/>
then hows it work internally

part 9)

some of life cycle hooks remain to learn on of which is 
    a) componentsWillUpdate()



    in shouldComponentUpdate() -->there is two parameter one of them is nextState and when we come from the componentDidMount() with some changing the state then y we have to compare nextState and previouse State wheras both will be the same bce after the componentDidMount() state will the change in to the constructer also
