context provided a way to pass data through the components tree kwithout having to pass props down manually at every level

it means that we can pass the data through grand-grand parent components to their grand-grand child components without passing props with the help of the contextapi in simple way

for this we use the React.createContext, this func then return an obj ( 1)provider  2)consumer  )
    a) using the provider at the top level of the components, we provided the data
    b)using the consumer, we can use the data(that is provided by the provider)

syntex:--> React.createContext(defautValue)
if we dont provided the value into the provided in that case comsumer use the defautValue

the components in which we use the provider, called provider components

the components in which we use the consumer, called consumer components
if we want to use the state(grand parent to child) in consumer components then we have to write something like this


it take thee callback func in which we get the data of the provider that we can render
<myContext.comsumer >
    
    {(data)=>/*render something based on the context data*/}

</ myContext.comsumer >
