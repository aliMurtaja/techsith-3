* we can put our image/assests into the two pls
    a) public folder
    b) src folder


in a)public folder :-->

if we put the file into the public folder it will not be proceed by the webpack
and when we builed the app, those file will be copied into the the builed folder untouched(webpack not touch)

to give the reference of the file into the public folder, we use the variable called PUBLIC_URL with prefix %%

note that in public folder none of the file(assests/image) will not be proceed by webpack


in b) src folder

with webpack, all assests/image/files work similar like css
you can import a file right in js module , this tells webpack to include that file in bundle

unlike css imports, importing a file you give a string value, this value is make the file path that u can reference in ur copied

note that in public folder the file(assests/image) will be proceed by webpack
